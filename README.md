# arma3_units

An interesting thought experiment using statically served files on GH (or other repo sources).

|Units|Links|
|---|---|
|The 22nd MEU (SOC)| [squad.xml](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/mwpowellhtx/arma3_units/trunk/the_22nd_meu_soc/squad.xml) |

In theory this _&apos;should&apos;_ work, but I am not quite certain that it does.
